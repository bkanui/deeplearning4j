# What Is DeepLearning4j?

DeepLearning4J is a java based toolkit for building, training and deploying Neural Networks. 

### DeepLearning4j Components
 
DeepLearning4J has the following sub-projects. 

* **[DataVec](#datavec)** performs data ingestion, normalization and transformation into feature vectors
* **[DeepLearning4j](#dl4j)** provides tools to configure neural networks and build computation graphs
* **[DL4J-Examples](#dl4jexamples)** contains working examples for classification and clustering of images, time series and text.
* **[Keras Model Import](#keras)** helps import trained models from Python and Keras to DeepLearning4J and Java. 
* **[ND4J](#nd4j)** allows Java to access Native Libraries to quickly process Matrix Data on CPUs or GPUs. 
* **[ScalNet](#scalnet)** is a Scala wrapper for Deeplearning4j inspired by Keras. Runs on multi-GPUs with Spark.

## <a name="datavec">DataVec</a>

Ingesting, cleaning, joining, scaling, normalizing and transforming data are jobs that must be done in any sort of analysis. This work may not be exciting, but it's a precondition of deep learning. DataVec is our toolkit for that process. We give data scientists and developers tools to turn raw data such as images, video, audio, text and time series into feature vectors for neural nets. 

### Github Repo

The DataVec Github repo is [here](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/datavec). Here is how the repo breaks down.

* [datavec-dataframe](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/DataVec/tree/master/datavec-dataframe) : DataVec's built-in equivalent of Pandas Dataframe
* [datavec-api](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/DataVec/tree/master/datavec-api) : rules for preprocessing data and defining data pipelines.
* [datavec-data](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/DataVec/tree/master/datavec-data) : knows how to understand audio, video, images, text data types
* [datavec-spark](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/DataVec/tree/master/datavec-spark) : runs distributed data pipelines on Spark 
* [datavec-local](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/DataVec/tree/master/datavec-local) : runs Datavec standalone on desktop. For inference. 
* [datavec-camel](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/DataVec/tree/master/datavec-camel) : connects to external Camel components. Camel allows you to define routes and integrates with many data sources. DataVec-camel sends data to datavec as a destination from whichever Camel source you specify.

### DataVec Examples

There are DataVec examples in our examples repo on Github [here](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/dl4j-examples).

A descriptive summary of many of the examples is [here](examples-tour).

### JavaDoc

DataVec JavaDoc is [here](./datavecdoc/). 

### DataVec overview

Neural Networks process multi-dimensional arrays of numerical data. Getting your data from a CSV file, or a directory of images serialized into numeric arrays is the job of DataVec. 

### DataVec: Commonly used classes

Here's a list of some important DataVec classes:

* Input Split

Splitting data into Test and Train

* **InputSplit.sample** to split data into Test and Train

Randomize Data

* **FileSplit.random** to randomize data

Base class for reading and serializing data. RecordReaders ingest your data input and return a List of Serializable objects (Writables). 

* **RecordReader**

Implementations of particular RecordReaders

* **CSVRecordReader** for CSV data
* **CSVNLinesSequenceRecordReader** for Sequence Data
* **ImageRecordReader** for images
* **JacksonRecordReader** for JSON data
* **RegexLineRecordReader** for parsing log files
* **WavFileRecordReader** for audio files
* **LibSvmRecordReader** for Support Vector Machine
* **VideoRecordReader** for reading Video

For re-organizing, joining, Normalizing and transforming data. 

* **Transform**

Specific Transform implementations

* **CategoricalToIntegerTransform** to convert category names to integers
* **CategoricalToOneHotTransform** convert catagory name to onehot representation
* **ReorderColumnsTransform** rearrange columns
* **RenameColumnsTransform** rename columns
* **StringToTimeTransform** convert timestring

The labels for data input may be based on the directory where the image is stored. 

* **ParentPathLabelGenerator** Label based on parent directory
* **PatternPathLabelGenerator** Derives label based on a string within the file path

DataNormalization

* **Normalizer**  Although part of  ND4J seems like it should be mentioned here

## <a name="arbiter">Arbiter</a>

Arbiter helps you search the hyperparameter space to find the best tuning and architecture for a neural net. This is important because finding the right architecture and hyperparamters is a very large combinatorial problem.
